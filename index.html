		<h1> Kim's JavaScript Page </h1>
		<h2> Open the Console on the Browser to View Results </h2>

		<script>
			// 1. VARIABLES

			// Variables: The following variables are numbers 

			var FirstThing = 39;
			console.log(FirstThing);

			var SecondThing = 42;
			console.log(SecondThing);

			var TwoThings = (FirstThing + SecondThing);
			console.log(TwoThings);

			// Variables: The following variables are words (which are "strings" of characters)

			var FirstFood = "Chili";
			console.log(FirstFood);

			var SecondFood = "ConCarne"
			console.log(SecondFood);

			var ComboFood = (FirstFood + SecondFood);
			console.log (ComboFood);


			//2. DEBUGGING

			//Alerts: Below is the code for an alert. It is a box that opens up in the browser with the output that you designate in the parentheses.
				// The box goes away when you click "OK"

			alert("The World Needs More Lerts");



			//Comments: You are reading a comment right now. It will not show up on the page. This is to write notes to yourself and other developers reading your code to clarify what you are doing.

				// A single-line comment is designated by the two slashes.
				/*You can also make comments like this.*/

				//You can use the comments to negate code you don't want to run

					// var FirstFood = "Chili";
					// console.log(FirstFood)

					// var SecondFood = "ConCarne"
					// console.log(SecondFood)

					// var ComboFood = (FirstFood + SecondFood);
					// console.log (ComboFood)

				// Create comments by clicking CRTL+? (I have a WINDOWS machine)


			// Console: The console is visible in the browser. It can show you the output for JavaScript.

			    // The JavaScript console can be opened in Google Chrome Ctrl + Option + J on Windows machines)

				// JavaScript can be run line by line inside of the console

				// You can also output to the console in javascript by using the following code

			console.log("This appears in the console");



			//3. DIFFERENT DATA TYPES

			//String: A line of non-numeric characters. Usually appear as words.

			console.log("Word");
			console.log("Name"); 
			console.log("asdfghjkl");
			console.log("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious");

			//Numbers: 

			console.log(1);
			console.log(256); 
			console.log(563241);
			console.log(3.14159);



			//Boolean: True or False statements

			//This is how you set up a True statement

			var BirdsCanFly=true;

			console.log (BirdsCanFly);
			
			// The console will tell you "true"

			// Use an exclamation point to negate a true statement

			console.log(!BirdsCanFly);


			//Undefined: the data has no value

			//We have not designated a value for this variable. Therefore, the variable below will return the word "undefined" in the console

			var PigsCanFly;

			console.log(PigsCanFly);
